\title{Using the LibBi wrapper to launch LibBi}
\arguments{
\item{add_options}{additional arguments to pass to the call to \code{libbi}}

\item{stdoutput_file_name}{path to a file to text file to report the output of \code{libbi}}

\item{init}{initialisation of the model, either supplied as a list of values and/or data frames, or a (netcdf) file name, or a \code{\link{libbi}} object which has been run (in which case the output of that run is used as input)}

\item{input}{input of the model, either supplied as a list of values and/or data frames, or a (netcdf) file name, or a \code{\link{libbi}} object which has been run (in which case the output of that run is used as input)}

\item{obs}{observations of the model, either supplied as a list of values and/or data frames, or a (netcdf) file name, or a \code{\link{libbi}} object which has been run (in which case the output of that run is used as observations)}

\item{time_dim}{The time dimension in any R objects that have been passed (\code{init}, \code{input}) and \code{obs}); if not given, will be guessed}

\item{...}{any onrecognised options will be added to \code{add_options}}

\description{
The method \code{run} of an instance of \code{\link{libbi}}
allows to launch \code{libbi} with a particular set of command line
arguments.
